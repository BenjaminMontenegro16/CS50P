📂 Week 4: Libraries, APIs & Logic Modules
This week focused on utilizing Python’s modularity to solve real-world problems, from financial tracking to regional utility tools, while implementing external libraries for live data.

🚀 Project 1: DNI-Age-Estimator (Based in Argentina)
A backend utility designed to estimate a person's age based on their DNI number, specifically calibrated for the Argentine registration system.

Logic Implementation: Developed a custom algorithm to map DNI numeric ranges to approximate birth years.

Regional Calibration: Focused on the Argentine National Registry data to ensure localized accuracy.

Data Handling: Implemented input validation to ensure the DNI provided follows the correct integer format.

🚀 Project 2: Dolar-to-Arg-Peso (Real-Time Converter)
A financial tool that tracks the volatile exchange rate in Argentina using live data.

API Integration: Fetches real-time exchange rates to ensure the converter "doesn't get old" as the market fluctuates.

Math Logic: Implemented dynamic multiplication to convert USD amounts into ARS based on the latest fetched rate.

Scalability: Designed the backend to update automatically without needing manual code changes for new rates.

🚀 Project 3: PuedoSalir (Posadas Editions)
Localized weather checkers that help users in Misiones decide if it's a good time to go outside.

Geographical Data: Created two distinct versions to handle the specific coordinates for both Dos de Mayo and Posadas.

External Modules: Utilized the requests library to communicate with weather service APIs.

Conditional Output: Developed a decision engine that interprets weather data to return a simple, user-friendly recommendation.

🚀 Project 4: Coin-Flip Simulator
A simple but effective probability tool using Python's built-in randomness modules.

Key Concept: Utilized the random library to simulate binary outcomes (Heads/Tails).

Logic Efficiency: Focused on writing clean, minimal code for quick iterative execution.
