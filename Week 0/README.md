📂 Week 0: Functions & Variables
This is where it all began. In Week 0, I focused on the core fundamentals of Python: interacting with the user, managing variables, and understanding the "Input-Process-Output" model.

🚀 Project 1: The First Greeting
A simple but foundational script to practice variable assignment and string interpolation.

Key Concept: Learning how to use input() to capture data and print() to display it.

F-Strings: Implemented f-strings for the first time to create dynamic, readable output.

🚀 Project 2: Sentiment Interaction Bot
An early interaction script that uses basic logic to respond to a user's mood.

Variable Manipulation: Practiced using .strip() to clean user data, ensuring extra spaces don't break the logic.

List Implementation: Used lists to store various "Good" and "Bad" keywords, an early introduction to data structures.

Decision Making: Implemented an if/elif/else structure to provide different responses based on user sentiment.

📓 Developer Insights for US Recruiters
The Starting Point: These projects represent my first hours of coding. They demonstrate my ability to quickly grasp syntax and apply it to interactive programs.

Communication: Even in my first scripts, I included social handles (X/Twitter) to show an openness to feedback and community engagement—key traits for a modern developer.

Vision: As I noted in my code, I recognized early on that these simple steps were the foundation for a professional career in backend development.
