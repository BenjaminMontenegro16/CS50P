📂 Week 2: Functions & Financial Logic
This week, I focused on structuring code using Functions and handling complex Conditional Logic to create a personal wealth and age milestone tracker.

🚀 Project: The "Path to Success" Tracker
A custom script designed to evaluate a user's financial status based on their age and savings.

Key Concept: Transitioning from "Scripting" to Functional Programming by using def main() and passing arguments to helper functions.

Data Sanitization: Implemented .strip() and .replace("$", "") to clean currency inputs, allowing the program to process numbers even if the user types a "$" sign.

Complex Conditionals: Utilized if/elif/else blocks to create specific milestones, including a custom check for the 2025 Aston Martin Vantage goal.

Execution Guard: Implemented if __name__ == "__main__": to follow professional Python standards for script execution.

📓 Developer Insights for US Recruiters
Clean Structure: By separating the "Input" (main) from the "Logic" (calculate_status), I am demonstrating an early understanding of the Single Responsibility Principle.

Goal-Oriented Code: This project incorporates real-world financial goals, showing an interest in building FinTech-related backend utilities.

Formatting: Practiced using f-strings and type conversion (int, float) to ensure data type consistency throughout the application.
