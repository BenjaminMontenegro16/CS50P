📂 Week 1: Conditionals & User Experience
This week, I focused on building interactive applications that use Control Flow to respond to user input in real-time.

🚀 Project: The "Aston Martin" Team Selector
A simple but effective script that uses membership testing to categorize user responses.

Key Concept: Transitioning from basic if/else to using Membership Operators (in) with predefined lists.

Input Sanitization: Utilized .strip() and .lower() to ensure the program remains robust even if the user types with extra spaces or capital letters.

User Experience (UX): Built a "fallback" condition (the else statement) to handle unexpected inputs—a key part of Defensive Programming.

String Formatting: Used f-strings to create a personalized experience by greeting the user by name.

📓 Developer Insights for US Recruiters
Membership Testing: Instead of writing multiple or statements (e.g., if x == "yes" or x == "yeah"), I used a list-based approach for cleaner, more scalable code.

Logic Flow: Demonstrated the ability to create multi-branch logic (if, elif, else) to handle different execution paths.

Consistency: This project reflects my personal drive and goals, showing that I build projects centered around my real-world ambitions.
