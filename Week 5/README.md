📂 Week 5: Unit Tests & API Integration
This week, I focused on making my code production-ready by implementing robust error handling, API consumption, and preparing for the Harvard CS50P unit testing modules.

🚀 Project 1: Dollar To Currencies (Telegram Bot)
My first full-scale Telegram bot that provides real-time currency conversion for the global market.

API Integration: Implemented requests to fetch live data from the Frankfurter API.

Backend Security: Utilized python-dotenv to keep sensitive API tokens outside the source code.

Error Handling: Implemented a try/except block to catch ValueError and IndexError, ensuring the bot stays online during bad user input.

UX Design: Used HTML parsing to create a professional currency list using <b> and <code> tags.

🚀 Project 2: "Can I Go Out?" (Weather Checker - Los Angeles)
A weather utility designed to help users in the USA decide if conditions are safe/comfortable for outdoor activities.

Localized Logic: Focused on the Los Angeles area to practice handling US-based weather metrics.

Condition Analysis: Evaluates temperature and sky conditions via external weather APIs.

Decision Engine: Implemented logic to return a simple "Yes/No" based on specific weather thresholds.

🚀 Project 3: "Puedo Salir" (Weather Checker - Dos de Mayo)
A localized version of the weather tool, tailored specifically for my hometown in Misiones, Argentina.

Regional Focus: Configured to monitor specific conditions for the Dos de Mayo region.

Language Adaptation: Practiced implementing localized string responses while keeping the backend logic in English.

Data Parsing: Extracted specific values from complex nested JSON dictionaries returned by the weather service.
