📂 Week 3: Data Structures & Loops
This week, I moved beyond simple variables to working with complex data structures like Lists of Dictionaries and implementing Iterative Logic for financial simulations.

🚀 Project 1: Investment Growth Simulator
A tool designed to calculate compound interest over a specified period.

Key Concept: Using for loops with a range to simulate time-based growth.

Math Logic: Implemented recursive balance updates.

Formatting: Utilized Python’s round() function and f-strings for clean output.

🚀 Project 2: Argentine Exchange Rate Finder (Dólar Tracker)
A search utility that parses a list of dictionaries to find specific exchange rate data.

Data Structure: Implemented a List of Dictionaries to store key-value pairs.

Sanitization: Used .strip() and .lower() to handle user input variations.

Search Logic: Implemented a linear search with a break statement to optimize performance.

🚀 Project 3: Password Security Checker
A backend utility that validates user passwords based on specific complexity requirements.

Security Mindset: Focused on verifying length and character diversity.

Validation: Used conditional logic to provide immediate feedback on security strength.
