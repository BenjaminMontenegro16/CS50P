📂 Week 3: Data Structures & LoopsThis week, I moved beyond simple variables to working with complex data structures like Lists of Dictionaries and implementing Iterative Logic for financial simulations.🚀 Project 1: Investment Growth SimulatorA tool designed to calculate compound interest over a specified period.Key Concept: Using for loops with a range to simulate time-based growth.Math Logic: Implemented recursive balance updates: $current\_balance = current\_balance + (current\_balance \times rate)$.Formatting: Utilized Python’s round() function and f-strings to ensure a clean, currency-style output.🚀 Project 2: Argentine Exchange Rate Finder (Dólar Tracker)A search utility that parses a list of dictionaries to find specific exchange rate data.Data Structure: Implemented a List of Dictionaries to store key-value pairs (name and cost).Sanitization: Used .strip() and .lower() to handle user input variations, ensuring the search is "case-insensitive".Search Logic: Implemented a linear search with a "Found" flag and break statement to optimize performance.🚀 Project 3: Password Security CheckerA backend utility that validates user passwords based on specific complexity requirements.Security Mindset: Focused on implementing logic to verify length and character diversity, a fundamental skill for authentication systems.Validation: Used conditional logic to provide immediate feedback on security strength.
